          <h4>Product Details</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Start of Mining: </strong>At the launch of the mainnet
            <a href='https://www.aleo.org/post/announcing-testnet-3' target='_blank'>
              (scheduled at Q1 2023)
            </a>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Mining Period: </strong>365 days (after mainnet launch)</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Service Fee: </strong>20%</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mining Algorithms: </strong>In order to optimally increase the mining machines' hash power,
            a large number of GPUs are integrated into a single mining machine. Due to to this, Procyon has
            decided to divide the hash power generated by 1 machine into 100 units.

            Aleo Technology
          </h3>

          <h4>Aleo is the first platform to offer fully private applications.</h4>

          <p>
            Aleo achieves privacy by leveraging decentralized systems and zero-knowledge cryptography to
            protect user data on the web. Using zero-knowledge cryptography, Aleo moves smart contract
            execution off-chain to enable a diverse range of decentralized applications that are both
            entirely private and can scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second. Built on an
            open, public blockchain, Aleo brings all the flexibility of Ethereum but with a more scalable
            architecture in which miners don’t need to re-run every transaction, but simply verify their correctness.
          </p>

          <h3 id='Why did Procyon choose Aleo?'>
            Why did Procyon choose Aleo?
          </h3>

          <p>
            In terms of VC investments Aleo somewhat similar to Filecoin. The total funding for Filecoin is $257 million,\
            while the total funding of Aleo is $228 million.
          </p>

          <p>Aleo's team is highly qualified and has a comprehensive strategy on how the service will be delivered to customers.</p>

          <p>
            On the technical side, Aleo offers one of the most important infrastructures of Web3’s future with its zero-knowledge
            proof – using ZKPs to achieve both privacy and programmability.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of Aleo's future ecosystem, Aleo has the potential to be the next Ethereum or Solana through its Layer 1 technology.
            Various applications will be developed on top of Aleo, as we have already seen with the strategic partnership with
            Forte - the gaming company. Aleo aims to become the solution to Web2's major drawbacks such as data leaks, private
            data monetization, and the permanent availability of leaked data.
